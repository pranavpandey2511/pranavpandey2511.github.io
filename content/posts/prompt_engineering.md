## Introduction

This post talks about prompt engineering in LLMs.
It is heavily inspired by OpenAI Cookbook, Andrew Ng course, and my personal experiments with ChatGPT.

There are two types of Large Language Models (LLms) that we need to know about to differentiate between previous models like GPT, BERT, and ChatGPT, LLAMA, Open_assistant.

|                 Base LLMs                  |                         Instruction Tuned LLMs                         |
| :----------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Base LLMs are trained to predict next word | These are trained to predict what the response should be a given input |
|              Row 2, Column 1               |                            Row 2, Column 2                             |

```python
def get_result():
    pass
```

<style>
    table {
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-right: auto;
    }
</style>
